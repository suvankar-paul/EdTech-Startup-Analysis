Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing EdTech data to provide strategic insights into recorded lectures. As a Data Analyst, I used Power BI to clean, process, and visualize data from various EdTech platforms. The goal is to help an EdTech startup optimize its offerings by identifying trends, audience engagement patterns, and opportunities for growth. The most important emphasis is category-wise analysis.

Viewer Engagement Insights: Calculate the average number of views for each category, subcategory, and language.

Skill Relevance Analysis: Identify the most commonly taught skills based on category to align course offerings with job market demands.

Language Preferences: Analyze the distribution of languages in which courses are created and determine viewer preferences.

Subtitle Impact Study: Investigate the relationship between subtitles and viewer engagement.

Top Instructors Analysis: Identify the top three instructors for each category and subcategory based on ratings.

Course Duration vs. Engagement: Examine the influence of course length on viewer preferences and engagement.

Skill Variety & Viewership Impact: Assess whether the variety of skills offered in each category affects viewership.
